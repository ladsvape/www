	<b>	Lads Vape </b>
<p>Lad's Vape has been in the making since 2015 years. The though and dream to have a vape store that doesn't source it product from a middle man, but makes and source directly to supply at competing price whiles being local to the nelson community is what I wish Lad's vape to be.</p>
<b> Passion </b>
<br>Our Passion is only to provide the best. Therefore we ask you, "What do you want?"</br>
<p> We want only to make high quality juices in the context of both purity and excellent flavour. We as Lad's Vape have more than 3 years of experience with understanding, using and making our products, and we want to put it to the test to see how you think of it.
What we make isn't just any home craft, it's in depth research which separates the good and the great.  In offering our option of products to choose from, we also offer you to customise your flavour. while also keeping the convinces with a competitive price. 
Every unit and batch made is with high quality, pure ingredient put together in a clean environment to minimize contamination. Tools and equipment used are sterilized or one off disposable unit.</p>
<br><b> Our Goal </b></br>
<p>As of this current moment we are reaching out to the vapers of Nelson, to understand what you wish to see for vaping in this region, the flavours you seek and the public response to vapes.
We vision to set a permanent site by mid of 2018 to offer range of juices, kits, mods and true self customization.  Until then we have a temporary site at a residential area, with a room dedicating to making our juices.</p>
