__Is It Safe?__

Vaping has been proven by reseaches from both in the United Kingdom and the Unted States that vaping is 95% more safer than smoking.

__What are the health _Risk_?__

Like all things we consume, there are health effects like eating too much sugar is link to higher rates in diabetes. However in relations to vaping there are 2 main ingredient we use to make the juices, Propalyne Gycol and Vegetable glyserin. These ingredients are already found in most of our day to day food and supplments, like oil capsals, moisterisers or food additives and extracts.

The health risk assoicted at this stage cannot be confirmed in the long term, as vaping has only been popular in since 2011. Only short term reseachs has been carried out, and most of which confirms that there are no major side effects; as long as one is _not allergic_ to the ingredient or boxed in a room with 80% or more concertration of vape to air ratio.

__What is in the Juices?__


Ummm, Propalyne Gycol and Vegetable Glyserin. People also add Nicotine but as it is still currently illegal to supply vapes with nicotine we do not add nicotine to market and sell to our users. Oh, and flavours e.g fruit extracts. [contains trade secrets]

# Torben, The experienced.

__Hi, Does it contain nicotine and if not where can I get nicotine?__

Hi Torben, Nicotine at of this moment cannot be sold to the public of New Zealand.
But, If you Email us at:
Ladsvape@gmail.com
We can send it to our branch, not bound to NZ Laws [Secrete Base] and have it Nic up and send it to you free of charge with no waste of time.
The consentration we offer is 3mg to all juices as anything more is too strong and too less is not registrable to the human body for pleasure.
